# Glove Controlled Vehicle
This is the major project I did with a partner for University.

The references we used are provided below. I may have left some out since I made this repository months after I did the project. It was a great experience making this although it was considered too simple for a major project (ouch!). We made a minimalistic app and test track to accompany the project but I've left those details out. I'm hoping anyone reading this can use the references and the provided code to recreate this. 

**Note:** My code is slightly different from the ones you'll find in the references since I started from scratch taking bits and pieces from the test programs for the parts and making it as simplistic as I could.
